class EventEmitterMixin(object):
    """Mixin to add event emitter features to a class.

    For interoperation with asyncio, one can specify the scheduler and
    the event loop. The scheduler defaults to ``asyncio.ensure_future``,
    and the loop defaults to ``None``. When used with the default scheduler,
    this will schedule the coroutine onto asyncio's default loop.

    This should also be compatible with recent versions of twisted by
    setting ``scheduler=twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred``.

    Most events are registered with EventEmitterMixin via the ``on`` and ``once``
    methods. However, event emitters have two *special* events:

    - ``new_listener``: Fires whenever a new listener is created. Listeners for
      this event do not fire upon their own creation.

    - ``error``: When emitted raises an Exception by default, behavior can be
      overriden by attaching callback to the event.

      For example::

          @ee.on('error')
          def onError(message):
              logging.err(message)

          ee.emit('error', Exception('something blew up'))

      For synchronous callbacks, exceptions are **not** handled for you---
      you must catch your own exceptions inside synchronous ``on`` handlers.
      However, when wrapping **async** functions, errors will be intercepted
      and emitted under the ``error`` event. **This behavior for async
      functions is inconsistent with node.js**, which unlike this package has
      no facilities for handling returned Promises from handlers.

        ``f`` to the event name ``event``.

        If ``f`` isn't provided, this method returns a function that
        takes ``f`` as a callback; in other words, you can use this method
        as a decorator, like so::

            @ee.on('data')
            def data_handler(data):
                print(data)

        As mentioned, this method can also take an asyncio coroutine function::

           @ee.on('data')
           async def data_handler(data)
               await do_async_thing(data)


        This will automatically schedule the coroutine using the configured
        scheduling function (defaults to ``asyncio.ensure_future``) and the
        configured event loop (defaults to ``asyncio.get_event_loop()``).

        In both the decorated and undecorated forms, the event handler is
        returned. The upshot of this is that you can call decorated handlers
        directly, as well as use them in remove_listener calls.
