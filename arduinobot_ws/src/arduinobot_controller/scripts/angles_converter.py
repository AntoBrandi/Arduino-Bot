"""
  arduinobot - angles_converter
  This script implements two services on the topics
    - radians_to_degrees
    - degrees_to_radians

  Both of them receives a request with the format:
    float64 base
    float64 shoulder
    float64 elbow 
    float64 gripper
  and sends a response in the same format to the client

  The first service (radians_to_degrees) receives the angles in radians and convert
  those in degrees according to the boundaries defined inthe URDF file

  The second service (degrees_to_radians) receives the angles in degrees and convert
  those in radians according to the boundaries defined inthe URDF file

  This conversion is needed for the control of the real robot in order to convert the radians angle of each joint
  as used in ROS in degrees angles as used in Arduino for the actuation of the Servo motors
